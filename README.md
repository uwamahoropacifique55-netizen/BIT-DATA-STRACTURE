  **ASSIGNMENT 3 PROJECT 3
  STACK AND QUEUE**


  STACK (LIFO â€“ Last In, First Out)

Think of a stack like a pile of plates. You add (push) on top, and remove (pop or undo) from the top.

LIFO = the last item added is the first to be removed.

ðŸ”¹ Stack Questions:

MoMo Push ["Step1", "Step2", "Step3"]. Undo 2. Which remains?

Push order: Step1 â†’ Step2 â†’ Step3

Undo 2 (pop 2): Step3 and Step2 removed

âœ… Remaining: ["Step1"]

UR pushes ["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]. Pop 1. Which is top?

Pop 1: Topic3 removed

âœ… Top now: Topic2

Challenge: Reverse "RWANDACODE" using stack

Push each letter to stack: R â†’ W â†’ A â†’ N â†’ D â†’ A â†’ C â†’ O â†’ D â†’ E

Pop all letters: E â†’ D â†’ O â†’ C â†’ A â†’ D â†’ N â†’ A â†’ W â†’ R

âœ… Reversed: "EDOCADNAWR"

Reflection: Why stack ensures last change first undone?

Because stack removes from the top, the most recent change (last-in) is the first undone (first-out).

Example: Undoing recent steps in a photo editor or calculator.

âœ… QUEUE (FIFO â€“ First In, First Out)

Think of a queue like people waiting in line.

First to enter is served first.

FIFO = first added is the first removed.

ðŸ”¹ Queue Questions:

RRA: 9 clients queue. After 6 served, who is front?

Clients: C1 to C9

After 6 served: C1â€“C6 gone

âœ… Front now: C7

RSSB: 7 clients queue. Who is third?

Clients: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7

âœ… Third: C3

Challenge: Queue vs stack for distributing exam scripts. Which is correct?

âœ… Queue is correct, because students should receive papers in the order they submitted (FIFO).

Stack would reverse the order (LIFO), which is unfair.

Reflection: Why FIFO ensures fairness in grading?

It processes work in order received, avoiding favoritism or delay.

âœ… Ensures equal treatment for all students.
